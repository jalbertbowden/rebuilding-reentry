Term,Definition
County Sentence ,"Prior to the “Truth in Sentencing” law, if an offender is sentenced to the House of Correction, the term shall be two and a half years or less. Parole eligibility and discharge are based on the maximum term of a sentence. Under the “new” law (enacted in 1994), discharge on this sentence will change because of the elimination of statutory good time. There is no change in the parole eligibility date."
Governing Offense ,The governing offense is the offense associated with the longest maximum release date.
Length of Incarceration ,"Length of incarceration represents the number of days between the inmate’s most recent incarceration which represents a new court commitment including county inmates sentenced from the court to serve a county sentence, parole violation, and probation violation on their current incarceration and their release to the street."
Lower Security ,"Lower security includes minimum, pre-release, and contract pre-release facilities."
Mandatory Drug Offenders ,Inmates serving a governing drug sentence that carries a mandatory minimum term.
Offense Category ,"Offense categories include Person, Property, Sex, Drug, and Other. Offense categories represent the inmate’s governing offense."
Race/Ethnicity ,"The race categories self reported and used in this report include: Caucasian, African American/Black, Asian, Hawaiian-Pacific Islander, and American Indian- Alaska Native. Inmates who report a Hispanic ethnicity are reported as Hispanic in this race category."
Recidivism Rate ,Number of inmates re-incarcerated within three years of their release to the street divided by the number of inmates released.
State Prison Sentence ,"Prior to the “Truth in Sentencing” law, if an offender is sentenced to the State Prison, except for life or as a habitual criminal, the court shall not fix the term of imprisonment, but shall fix a maximum and minimum term for which he/she may be imprisoned. The minimum term shall not be less than two and a half years. All sentences that have a finite maximum term are eligible to have the term reduced by statutory good time, except for most sex offenses, crimes committed while confined and certain “mandatory” sentences. In the “new law”, all state sentences have a minimum and a maximum term, unless an inmate is sentenced for life or is charged as a habitual criminal. The minimum term is used to determine parole eligibility, and the maximum term is used to determine discharge. Under both the “old” and “new” sentencing systems, an inmate is discharged from his/her sentence at the expiration of his term, less any statutory or earned good time. Under the “new” system none of the reduction will be attributable to statutory good time."
Violent/Non-Violent Offense ,"Person and Sex offenses are combined into the category ‘Violent Offenses’. Property, Drug, and ‘Other’ offenses are categorized into ‘Non-Violent’ offenses."
